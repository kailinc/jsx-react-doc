JSX in Depth

JSX just provides syntactic sugar for React.createdElement(components, props, ...children) function

<myButton color="blue" shadowSize={2}>Click me </myButton>

compiles into

React.createElement(
  MyButton,
  {color: 'blue', shadowSize: 2}, // seems like css is wrapped in {}
  'Click Me'
)

can use self-closing form of tag is there are no children

ex:
<div className="sidebar" />

compiles into

React.createElement(
  'div',                   // seems to be the anchor tag
  {className: 'sidebar'}, // css and classes
  null                    // text (there is none so = null)
)

online Babel compiler will test out how specific JSX converts into JS
